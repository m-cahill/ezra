# M40 — Milestone audit (planning closeout)

**Milestone:** M40 — Public Release Operation / Visibility Decision  
**PR:** https://github.com/m-cahill/ezra/pull/44  
**Mode:** Planning-only closeout documentation

---

## Prompt sources

The following paths were **requested** for audit/summary generation but are **absent** (M37 boundary; `docs/prompts/` not on Git surface):

- `docs/prompts/summaryprompt.md` — **missing**
- `docs/prompts/unifiedmilestoneauditpromptV2.md` — **missing**

This audit uses the **M36–M39** audit structure and the explicit closeout criteria from the maintainer follow-up.

---

## Scope compliance

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Planning-only | **Pass** | `M40_plan.md` restricts scope; no operational commands executed by this milestone’s agents |
| No visibility/tag/release/PyPI/Pages | **Pass** | No `gh repo edit`, `git tag`, `gh release create`, or settings changes |
| No runtime/workflow/deps/EPB edits in planning PR | **Pass** | PR #44 file set is docs/milestones/M40 + `REFACTOR.md` + `docs/ezra.md` |

---

## Invariant preservation

| Invariant | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| EPB v1.0.0 / no spec edits | **Preserved** — no `docs/specs/epb_v1/**` changes |
| Public boundary | **Preserved** — no edits to boundary paths; planning does not add tracked `docs/prompts/` |
| M39 verdict | **Preserved** — **`GO WITH DOCUMENTED LIMITATIONS`** |

---

## Decision-path completeness

| Element | Present in `M40_plan.md` |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Visibility options + approval gate | Yes — §5 Decision A, §7 Step 2 |
| Tag/release after visibility, naming TBD | Yes — §5 Decision B |
| Pages / SLSA / Dependency Review carry-forward | Yes — §5 Decision C |
| Preflight + post-operation verification | Yes — §6 |
| Risk / rollback honesty (public irreversibility of clones) | Yes — §8 |

---

## Precondition artifact inventory

Referenced M39 and release docs are **present** in a full checkout (see `M40_plan.md` §3). **Note:** `docs/milestones/` may be gitignored locally; milestone files may require `git add -f` for PRs.

---

## Implementation authorization

**Not authorized** by this audit. M40 planning documents the path; **explicit maintainer approval** is required before any execution branch or operational step (per `M40_plan.md` §7).

---

## Release operations occurred?

**No.** No repository visibility change, tag, GitHub Release, PyPI publish, or Pages enablement was performed under M40 planning.

---

## PR #44 merge readiness (CI)

**Evidence — initial planning commit `1d9b698c3e74859e8d2e4cc5774b2ff75871668b`:**

- Run: https://github.com/m-cahill/ezra/actions/runs/25523547470

**Evidence — closeout commits on PR #44:**

- `6622e86105928e0329622672cc963ef76c83194f` (closeout artifacts): run https://github.com/m-cahill/ezra/actions/runs/25523801823 — workflow **`conclusion: success`**
- `857ddc04a2a135a41645abc10b96371c6deaf321` (audit/summary CI reference update): run https://github.com/m-cahill/ezra/actions/runs/25523871508 — workflow **`conclusion: success`**
- `c3d05db5224d52e91363e4eb9a79373742c42d58` (audit aligned to tip CI): run https://github.com/m-cahill/ezra/actions/runs/25523947418 — workflow **`conclusion: success`**

**Rollup (PR tip at report time `c3d05db…`):**

- **Merge state:** `MERGEABLE`; `mergeStateStatus`: **`UNSTABLE`** (PR UI rollup affected by one job).
- **Failed / non-passing check:** **Dependency Review** — `FAILURE` (known M39 limitation: GHAS / dependency graph; job uses `continue-on-error: true` in workflow; **not introduced by M40 docs**).
- **All M40-relevant correctness gates:** **SUCCESS** on run **`25523947418`** (Lint, Type Check, Test, Security/`pip-audit`, Distribution Verification, Documentation Build, determinism/hermetic jobs, etc.).
- **Skipped (expected):** SLSA Provenance (push/fork context), Documentation Deploy (gated), release-artifact Distribution Verification (workflow_dispatch only).

**Verdict:**

```text
Planning complete — pending merge review
```

Merge remains a **maintainer decision**; this audit does **not** merge PR #44.
